# Feather

An experimental Minecraft server implementation written in Rust.

This is only a hobby project, so don't expect it to go anywhere.

A console client based on Feather's core code is also planned, and it may actually be functional
at some point in the future.

### Features
- [x] Players can join
- [x] Players can see MOTD and ping in server list (status ping)
- [x] Players can see a blandly generated, superflat stone world upon joining

Nothing else works yet.
